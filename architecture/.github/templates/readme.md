# Project Name

## Overview

This project exists to address a clearly defined problem within a specific domain.

It provides a focused solution with explicit boundaries, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

---

## Problem Statement

Current solutions in this domain fail to adequately address the identified problem due to limitations in clarity, scalability, or maintainability.

This project was initiated to close that gap by offering a more structured and intentional approach.

---

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to deliver a system that reliably solves the defined problem while maintaining clear boundaries and long-term evolvability.

The system prioritizes correctness, clarity, and architectural integrity over feature breadth.

---

## Target Users / Systems

This project is intended for:

- Backend services that require a clear and predictable integration point
- Internal systems that depend on well-defined contracts
- Developers seeking a maintainable and extensible solution within this domain

---

## High-Level Scope

At a high level, the system focuses on a single, well-defined responsibility within its domain.

It is not intended to be a general-purpose solution or a full platform.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

This project does **not** aim to:

- Provide user interface components
- Solve problems outside the defined domain
- Act as a full-featured platform or framework
- Optimize prematurely for scale or performance

---

## Role of This Document

This README represents the conceptual foundation of the project.

All future requirements, architectural decisions, and implementations must remain consistent with the intent described here.

If the intent changes, this document must be updated accordingly.
