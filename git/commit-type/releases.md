Semantic Versioning uses the format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- MAJOR → 1, 2, 3… → breaking changes or official release
- MINOR → 0, 1, 2… → new features, backward-compatible

- PATCH → 0, 1, 2… → bug fixes, refactors, small improvements

So for pre-1.0:

- 0.1.0 → first release
- 0.2.0 → added features, refactors, still experimental
- 0.3.0 → next set of improvements
- 1.0.0 → first stable production-ready release
